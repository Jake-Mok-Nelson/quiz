# Quiz
A quiz website to assist with post-lesson tests.

In general standardised testing is abelist crap. These quizes acknowledge that and aim to teach the as part of the testing process.

The score isn't recorded other than being displayed once at the end of a quiz.

This website is currently live at https://quiz.jakenelson.cloud and using Github pages as a host.
